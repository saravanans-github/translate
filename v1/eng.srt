1
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,440
Practice.

2
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,080
Yes.

3
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,480
Keep your back straight.
Good.

4
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,160
Yes. That's my child.

5
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,720
Adele, let's see.

6
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,520
Yes, that's it.
Point your toes.

7
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,640
Open your arms out to second.

8
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,760
This arm out to second.

9
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,720
I need you
to stretch to the side.

10
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,440
You must always
stand like this, Deni.

11
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,960
Then you will look very nice.
Now smile a little bit.

12
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,640
Yes.

13
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,720
Yes, Betrisya. Do this.

14
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,800
Yes, we've got
the 3 best friends there.

15
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,080
Congratulations, Betrisya.

16
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,200
Congratulations!

17
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,800
Congratulations, Deni.

18
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,960
Last but not least...

19
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,000
...Adele!

20
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,720
Congratulations!

21
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,760
Thank you!

22
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,880
Yes!

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,560
This is just the beginning.
You will be getting...

24
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,960
...a lot more prizes, dear!
I'm so proud of you!

25
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,840
<i>Police believe the extremists</i>
<i>are headed by professionals.</i>

26
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,880
Adele.

27
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,080
The moment of truth.

28
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,240
All praises to Allah.

29
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,200
Adele, I'm so proud of you!

30
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,600
I got accepted!

31
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,960
I got accepted!
–Me too!

32
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,800
Oh my God!
–Congratulations!

33
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,640
I'm really sorry that you
won't be coming with us, Deni.

34
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,400
Russia is so far.
We will surely miss you.

35
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,560
Don't worry about me.
You two are amazing.

36
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,280
I'm just happy knowing
that you made it.

37
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,480
There are many
roads to success, Deni.

38
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,280
You'll find it.

39
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,760
I know it.

40
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,080
Last order of the day.

41
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,760
I want to run another
piece on the hijab...

42
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,760
...but with a different
point of view.

43
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,320
I hear the Malay style is
being adopted all over...

44
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,240
...the world at the moment.

45
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,560
It's not exciting enough.

46
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,640
I want something
bigger than that.

47
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,280
Do you have anything?

48
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,120
Style!
–Style.

49
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,520
We have to put the Muslimah
style at the forefront.

50
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,760
Create an awareness.

51
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,600
Create?

52
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,720
That is a great angle for a story.

53
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,920
Yes!

54
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,520
As long as we are not telling
people to uncover their awrah...

55
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,120
...or wear a hijab but
still reveal their awrah.

56
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,880
Finally, all our
dreams have come true.

57
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,880
Congratulations!
–Thank you, Dad!

58
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,200
Come.
Let's celebrate.

59
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,240
No! There's no need.

60
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,200
We have to celebrate!

61
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,160
Our little girl is now...

62
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,400
...a superstar!

63
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,160
Your dreams are going
to come to fruition...

64
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,240
...and all of our hardwork
is finally paying off!

65
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,960
All the training,
costume fittings,...

66
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,560
...the long practice sessions
day and night,...

67
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,240
...the journey to and from
shows during weekends.

68
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,400
Thank you to those toes
that bear all the pain!

69
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,080
Tell me about it.

70
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,240
Sometimes I can tell that you...

71
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,160
...hide your worries.
Am I right?

72
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,760
I work hard because I worry!

73
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,720
You are clever just
like your grandmother.

74
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,840
Speaking of your grandmother,
tomorrow we'll go back...

75
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,960
...and visit her.

76
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,040
But now...

77
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,960
...we have to celebrate!

78
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,800
I'm too big to be carried!

79
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,200
But you're still my little girl!

80
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,520
Let's go!
–Wait for me!

81
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,040
Grandmother!
–Adele!

82
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,760
Hi!

83
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,400
What a surprise!
–We were in the area.

84
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,760
Peace be upon you, Mum.
–Peace be upon you, too.

85
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,840
This lovely young lady
still needs to improve...

86
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,440
...her recitation of the Quran.
So she needs to stay here...

87
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,680
...for the time being.
Until when?

88
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,160
I can't say.

89
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,680
We have come with good news, Mum.

90
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,760
You have good news?

91
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,440
You've made a decision?

92
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,560
I got into ballet school!

93
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,840
Congratulations, Adele!

94
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,360
Come in. You must be hungry.
You travelled a long journey.

95
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,960
Let's go inside.

96
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,200
<i>You shouldn't live</i>
<i>your unmet ambitions...</i>

97
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,640
<i>...through another...</i>

98
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,360
<i>...no matter how</i>
<i>close she is to you.</i>

99
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,640
Ballet is Adele's dream too.

100
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,440
It is better if she chooses
her own path in life.

101
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,360
We have chosen the same path, Mum.

102
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,640
No one forced Adele into this.

103
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,640
Plus, this is the role
of the parents, Mum.

104
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,840
To place the child in a place
where she can thrive...

105
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,280
...in everything she does.

106
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,760
Everything? There are
things that you didn't do.

107
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,320
I know what you mean by that.

108
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,920
I'm not ready for this...

109
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,160
...and it's not yet
the time for it!

110
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,920
Adele and I have a dream
that we can achieve...

111
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,320
...and it is
really beautiful, Mum.

112
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,160
You can't force me stop!

113
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,240
Dreams are beautiful,
but they are fragile.

114
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,360
What's important is that we are
obedient to the commands of Allah.

115
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,080
We have to keep our faith strong.

116
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,160
Rooted in a firm foundation.

117
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,120
Goodbye, Mum.
May peace be upon you.

118
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,880
Are you sure you want
to stay here, Adele?

119
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,440
Let her strengthen
her spirituality here.

120
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,280
Breathe in the fresh air
of the open space...

121
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
...like it is here...

122
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,040
...before she goes
to Russia all by herself.

123
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,080
She won't be going
there all by herself, Mum.

124
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Betrisya will be with her too.

125
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,480
Plus, I won't let
her go to Russia all alone.

126
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,760
I'll be going with her.

127
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,080
Bye, dear.
Take good care, okay dear?

128
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,440
Goodbye, Mum.

129
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,040
Call me, all right?
–Okay.

130
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,760
Peace be upon you, Mum.
–Peace be upon you too.

131
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,400
<i>How are we going to</i>
<i>learn Russian? It's so hard!</i>

132
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,000
We'll manage. I'm sure
it's beautiful over there.

133
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,840
Cold, but beautiful.

134
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,160
<i>Really cold!</i>

135
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,240
<i>Too bad Deni won't</i>
<i>be there to keep you warm.</i>

136
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,320
Betrisya! Winter clothes
will do, okay?

137
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,960
<i>I know.</i>

138
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,160
<i>You know</i>
<i>that you like him too.</i>

139
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,640
<i>He likes you too.</i>

140
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,040
We are friends.
Friends like one another.

141
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,720
<i>But this is more than that.</i>
<i>I'm his friend too...</i>

142
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,360
<i>...but he doesn't look at</i>
<i>me the way he looks at you.</i>

143
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,200
You're crazy.
<i>–You are crazy in love!</i>

144
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,360
I am only crazy for Russia!

145
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,920
<i>That's amazing!</i>
<i>Where are you practicing?</i>

146
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,880
With my mum.

147
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,360
<i>We are given a choice.</i>
<i>A choice to display virtue...</i>

148
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,000
<i>...or vice...</i>

149
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,120
<i>...if we do not restrain...</i>

150
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,840
<i>...through our actions</i>
<i>and the way we dress.</i>

151
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,760
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>Are you still there?</i>

152
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,480
Yes. I'm here.

153
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,240
Adele, take a look at this one.
Isn't it pretty?

154
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,920
It's pretty.
–Try it on for me.

155
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,240
This is your favourite
colour, isn't it?

156
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,280
It's a soft colour.

157
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,120
It's nice!
I'll buy this one for you.

158
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,760
I don't know.
I'm not ready for it.

159
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,960
It's okay. Just take one.

160
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,880
Just keep it. Who knows,
one day when you are ready...

161
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,480
...you'll have one in hand.
Right?

162
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,720
Okay, just in case.

163
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,640
RM100.
RM50.

164
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,520
What will I do if I miss you?

165
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,240
I'll be back before
you even know it.

166
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,320
Russia's gain is our loss.

167
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,200
Promise me that you
won't forget your roots.

168
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,400
Even though the branches of a tree
grow in different directions,...

169
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:50,320
...the roots will still remain
where the tree was first planted.

170
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,880
I know where
the soil is richest.

171
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,720
All praises to Allah.

172
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,320
I love this part.
It always get me so excited.

173
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,920
Me too. It's a shame the
shoes don't last that long.

174
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,440
That's the beauty of it.
They dance together with us.

175
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,840
Those who watch the performance
will not forget it.

176
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,480
We are like Romeo
and these shoes...

177
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,520
...are like Juliet.

178
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,000
I wonder what your
first performance will be.

179
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,280
Swan Lake.
I love the costumes.

180
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,680
I want it
to be Sleeping Beauty.

181
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,320
It's always been my favourite.

182
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,720
Whatever it is,
I can't wait to watch it.

183
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,520
Are you going to visit us?

184
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,600
Of course.

185
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,200
Did you think it would
be that easy to escape from me?

186
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,880
I wonder what we would
do if we didn't dance.

187
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,160
I don't know.

188
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,120
I can't see myself doing
anything else other than dance.

189
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,600
You don't have anything
else to fall back on?

190
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,040
No.
–You don't?

191
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,640
A person as organised as you
would usually have a plan.

192
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,960
My life is empty without ballet.

193
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,240
Guys, wait!

194
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,920
Thank you.
–Thanks.

195
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,040
Who knows?

196
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,080
One day we might dance
to the great love story...

197
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,600
...of Adele and Deni!

198
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,840
No. Stories like that...

199
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,120
...usually have a tragic ending.

200
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,480
Finally you admit to it!
–I've given up trying...

201
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,320
...to convince you otherwise.

202
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,560
Great!
Now we can plan your wedding!

203
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,680
Have you ever thought
about wearing it?

204
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,240
My mum wants me to, but I told her
it's not possible in our world.

205
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,800
My mum and I have
never talked about it.

206
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,920
That means she understands
the world of ballet. You're lucky.

207
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,880
Your mum isn't like my mum.

208
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,800
But I do often talk about
it with my grandmother.

209
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,360
You're willing to give up your
hardwork for the hijab?

210
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,760
No. Of course not.

211
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,960
You can't let all your talent
and hardwork go to waste...

212
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,040
...over a piece of cloth.

213
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,880
It isn't just a piece of cloth.

214
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,040
I know, but there's no way
the world of ballet...

215
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,400
...will ever accept the hijab.

216
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,000
Adele, we're still young.

217
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,760
We have a long life ahead of us.

218
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,040
We can wear the hijab when
we're old, sitting by the lake...

219
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,080
...at the countryside one day.

220
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,920
It's just not possible
the two worlds can co–exist.

221
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,440
Let's go.
–All right.

222
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,040
I can't wait for the day I can
pull off a Grand Jete like you.

223
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,640
One day I will have...

224
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,640
...a poster of you
on my bedroom wall!

225
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,640
You are my inspiration, Adele.

226
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,720
Don't make me blush.

227
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,960
Only Deni can do that.

228
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,520
From the earth
did We create you...

229
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
...and into it
shall We return you...

230
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,800
...and from it shall We
bring you out once again.

231
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,880
In the name of Allah
and with Allah,...

232
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,640
...and from Allah,
and to Allah,...

233
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,920
...and in the name
of the religion of Rasulullah.

234
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:19,560
This is the promise of God and the
truth brought by the messengers.

235
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,320
<i>It could have been me.</i>

236
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,600
<i>It's not just a hijab.</i>
<i>Awrah is everything we do.</i>

237
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,640
<i>It is our actions,</i>
<i>what we say,...</i>

238
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,000
<i>...and it is who we are.</i>

239
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,800
<i>Sometimes we forget</i>
<i>the awrah...</i>

240
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,560
<i>...isn't just for women.</i>
<i>It isn't just the hijab.</i>

241
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,800
Adele?

242
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,440
If you're not having
dinner with me tonight,...

243
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,840
...are you going out with
your friends?

244
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,600
I don't have anyone I can call.

245
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,920
I know this is hard for you.

246
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,360
But I don't know what to do.

247
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:09,200
I'm sure that with time,
things will get back to normal.

248
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,080
You'll miss the train.

249
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,560
It's all right.
I'll take the next one.

250
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,760
Let's go for a drink.

251
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,600
It's okay.
I have a class to go to.

252
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,760
Sorry, Mum.
I have to go.

253
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,160
5, 6, 7, 8.

254
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,760
1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.

255
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,760
6, 7, 8 and 1,...

256
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,600
...2, 3, 4, and 5,...

257
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,320
...6, 7, 8.

258
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,720
All right. Stretch it out.

259
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,800
What are you doing?

260
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,360
I'm stretching.

261
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,560
Why are you wearing that?
Take it off!

262
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,960
You can't dance in it.

263
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,400
It doesn't restrict me.
–It restricts us!

264
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,800
Is that your dance attire?

265
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,720
This is my dance attire now.

266
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,160
You act so high and mighty.

267
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,320
You're no different from
the rest of us, Adele.

268
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,240
If you're going to be
like that, you should leave.

269
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,880
Get back to your positions.

270
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,600
You're not ready to be back here.

271
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,200
I am ready.

272
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,240
You don't need to rush into this.

273
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,960
This is ridiculous!

274
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,560
I can't practice with her...

275
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,960
...wearing that.
–Me neither.

276
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,000
Get back to your positions.
Continue stretching.

277
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,280
Why didn't you stand up for me?

278
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,800
I didn't know how to.

279
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,400
What do you mean?

280
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,320
I'm sorry, Adele, but
everything they said was right.

281
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,120
How can you say that?

282
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,080
Everything that we are doing is
against what the hijab stands for!

283
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,160
What happened to the
girl who once said...

284
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,480
...that her life
is empty without ballet?

285
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,320
She found her roots...

286
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,680
...where the soil is richest.

287
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,280
Surely you're
not okay with this.

288
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,360
She will make
a mockery of this company.

289
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,400
Our company. Your company.

290
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,880
Of course not.

291
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,640
I will not
allow her to wear that...

292
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,640
...during any performance.
She is confused right now!

293
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,280
When it comes to the hijab,
you can't just wear it...

294
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,960
...on and off, as you please!

295
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,360
We're all going through
a hard time at the moment.

296
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,960
She is only making things worse.

297
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,200
She is always
coming in late now.

298
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,400
That is if she comes at all.

299
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,680
And now this!
–She should be expelled!

300
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,240
If it was anybody else, they
would have been expelled.

301
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,240
You know we're right.

302
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,320
<i>Assalamualaikum.</i>
Can I help you?

303
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,120
Maybe. Maybe not.

304
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,000
I'm looking for
something modest...

305
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,800
...but flexible for me
to move around in.

306
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,400
Modest but flexible
to move around in.

307
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,720
I'm a ballet dancer.

308
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,560
It might be hard to find,
but it's not impossible.

309
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,920
It's all right.
I'll help you find something.

310
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,840
Okay, this one is not
too tight nor too loose.

311
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,720
You can try it.
–Okay.

312
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,560
Adele, we are worried.

313
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,200
Where did my little girl go?

314
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,920
Who is this proud Muslim
woman standing before me?

315
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,800
I'm not a little girl anymore.

316
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,280
Yes, you're almost
as tall as me now.

317
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,320
Can we talk?

318
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,960
So that we can understand
what's on your mind.

319
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,400
It's all very clear.

320
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,440
What else is there to know?

321
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,320
Why now?

322
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,760
Adele, your decision is noble.

323
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,680
But I don't understand.
Why now?

324
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,000
Adele, why now?

325
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,000
You can't wear it,
and then take it off again...

326
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,960
...whenever you dance.

327
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,760
I don't think you're
ready for all of this.

328
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,200
I will not take off my hijab...

329
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,640
...and I will not
stop dancing ballet.

330
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,440
What about Russia?

331
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,760
Russia will get used to it.

332
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,480
Adele, if it's
not accepted here...

333
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,840
...how do you expect
Russia to accept it?

334
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,440
Use your common sense, Adele.

335
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,680
Impossible!

336
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,600
How are you going to dance
if you're wearing the hijab?

337
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,120
Yes!

338
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,640
That's what everyone
keeps telling me.

339
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,600
Adele!
–Diana!

340
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,760
Calm down. Let her be.

341
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,960
Calm down?
What are we going to do?

342
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,160
We don't need
to do anything right now.

343
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,280
I bet my mother has
something to do with this.

344
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,720
Adele is old enough to make
her own decisions, Diana.

345
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,600
Old enough?
–Yes.

346
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,000
She will be going
to Russia in another 3 months!

347
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,920
Do you think that they
will accept all this?

348
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,200
Maybe this is all temporary.

349
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,040
I don't think so.

350
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,000
Impossible.

351
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,240
If this is the case,
Russia is out of the picture!

352
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,840
Or maybe we just postpone
her studies there!

353
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,040
I don't want her
ballet career ruined!

354
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,520
Yes.

355
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,760
Yes, I am her mother.

356
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,200
We would like
to defer for one year.

357
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,000
I'm afraid that I really...

358
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,760
...can't allow it.

359
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,640
I understand.

360
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,440
I will be so disappointed
if I lose her.

361
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,200
We will not lose her.

362
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,520
She will come around.

363
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,360
I just hope
that will happen soon.

364
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,200
She needs to continue
training to get herself ready...

365
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,200
...for Russia.

366
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,040
I've deferred her place.
–What do you mean?

367
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,800
I have postponed and
discussed this with her school.

368
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,960
Does she know?

369
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,440
I'm planning
to tell her tonight...

370
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:00,520
...and I know this news
will really disappoint her.

371
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,040
She is a smart girl.

372
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,680
It's just that she can't
think clearly right now.

373
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,200
I think that losing someone
can make us all like that.

374
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,520
How could you do this?

375
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,440
Because this is
what's best for you.

376
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,040
It doesn't feel that way.

377
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,920
Adele Shakiri, listen
to your mother carefully.

378
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,200
You're not thinking straight
right now. That's why you need...

379
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,360
...some guidance
in matters like this!

380
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,920
The Quran guides me...

381
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,400
...and I have chosen
the path of truth.

382
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,320
Do you not agree with the Quran?

383
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,760
You don't wear the hijab...

384
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,640
...and you're
not dancing anymore.

385
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,960
So there shouldn't
be any excuse for you.

386
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,280
Why is that, Mum?

387
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,560
Adele?

388
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,960
Diana?

389
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,120
What do you want me to do?

390
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,560
Nothing for now.

391
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,920
Just let her be.
–Come and sit here.

392
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,200
What is happening to our family?

393
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,120
We can't let this go on, Diana.

394
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,640
I hate this feeling.

395
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,680
We have to accept this situation.

396
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,760
That's how a person who
has given up would think.

397
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,480
But this is what she wants, Diana!

398
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,960
We can't let her
ruin her future...

399
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,920
...just like that!

400
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,400
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

401
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,960
1, 2, 3.

402
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,840
Soutenu.

403
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,840
1, 2, 3.
Soutenu.

404
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,400
Ibtihaj Muhammad,
30–year–old saber fencer...

405
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,400
...currently training
for the next Olympics.

406
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,760
She wears the hijab.

407
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,200
Amaiya Zafar.
15–year–old amateur boxer.

408
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,280
Currently lobbying the...

409
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,000
...International
Boxing Association...

410
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,440
...to allow her dress code
into the competition.

411
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,040
She's halfway there.

412
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,880
Zahra Lari.

413
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,120
21–year–old figure skater.

414
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,920
Almost like we do, but on ice.

415
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,320
Amna al Haddad.

416
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,360
26–year–old weightlifter.

417
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,240
Just because you
can't see her muscles...

418
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,800
...doesn't mean you
can't see her strength.

419
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,240
Open your eyes, everybody.

420
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,360
The world is slowly changing...

421
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,080
...and it's women
and girls like these...

422
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,320
...who dare to try.

423
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,800
They pave the way
for everyone else.

424
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,880
In a few years, it will
be completely normal...

425
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,120
...to watch a Muslim ballet!

426
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,280
Adele.

427
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,320
You can't interrupt our class.

428
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,840
Is that all you care about?

429
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,600
We are practicing!

430
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,080
I want to come back.

431
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,080
Not dressed like this.

432
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,360
Hi, peace be upon you.
–Peace be upon you too.

433
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,160
How can I help you?
–I need your help.

434
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,400
I was in here the other day and
I saw you assisting a young lady.

435
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,280
She was wearing a hijab and
she said she was a ballet dancer.

436
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,160
Is that right?

437
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,320
Ya, that's right.

438
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,160
What is it?
How can I help you?

439
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,120
She is amazing!

440
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,560
How can I contact her?

441
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,120
Do you have her address
or telephone number?

442
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,120
Anything that I can
contact her with?

443
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,240
No, actually I am
a magazine writer.

444
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,680
I'm planning to write an
article about her. That's all.

445
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,760
That's interesting.

446
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,960
If I'm not mistaken, she
did give her e–mail address...

447
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,480
...to get discount promotions.
Let me check.

448
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,200
All right.

449
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,120
<i>Police: Extremists are</i>
<i>expected to attack.</i>

450
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,640
Deni!

451
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,560
How are you?
–I am good.

452
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,120
How are you?
–I am good.

453
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,400
Have a seat here.

454
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,480
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

455
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,320
Who says so?
You should be here.

456
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
You may be able to help us.

457
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,800
I don't know. I feel
like she wouldn't want...

458
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,880
...to talk to me.

459
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,560
You wait her.
Let me talk to her, okay?

460
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,120
Adele, open the door.

461
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,960
I don't want to see him.

462
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,560
Don't be like that.

463
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,800
Come out for a bit and
say hello. He's our guest.

464
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,760
Adele, I have never
raised you to be like this.

465
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,000
How are you?

466
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,000
I'm good.

467
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,600
I miss seeing that smile.

468
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,320
Why are you here, Deni?

469
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,240
I'm here to help.

470
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,040
How? I won't change my mind.

471
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,320
I know.

472
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,720
I'm here to help
you write a letter.

473
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,680
A letter?

474
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,360
An appeal letter to the school.

475
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,560
You're on my side?

476
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,600
Of course!

477
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,920
Adele, I can't
imagine you not dancing.

478
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,680
It doesn't matter how you dress.

479
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,680
Listen, Adele.

480
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,320
You want to pave
the way for change.

481
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,680
Open a new path for others.

482
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,040
But the responsibility
you bear is really heavy.

483
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,680
That's why you need me.

484
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,760
Thank you, Deni! You don't
know how much this means to me!

485
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,760
It's very inspiring
for the faith.

486
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,040
But would it be
inspiring for ballet?

487
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,320
This is something new.

488
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,960
After some time,
it will be forgotten.

489
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,960
Ballet is revealing.

490
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,760
Hijab is concealing.

491
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,800
How can one see its beauty
when everything is concealed?

492
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,640
The male dancers are not
allowed to touch her, right?

493
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,720
So how is she supposed to do
turns, lifts or promenades?

494
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,080
I don't agree with having
her as the principal dancer.

495
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,760
Farah?

496
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,160
She has extraordinary
talent and potential.

497
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,920
She's really one of the best.

498
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:13,160
But what she is doing is
against the principles...

499
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,240
...and the beauty of this art.

500
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,240
The audience needs to see
every movement and curve...

501
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,320
...of the limbs and
the muscles in the body.

502
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,120
That is the art of ballet.

503
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,200
That is what we do,
and that is why...

504
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,280
...they come to watch ballet.

505
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:36,000
When she wears a hijab, she
is no longer a ballet dancer.

506
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,280
In that case, we will
uphold our decision.

507
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,680
I don't need them.

508
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,360
I'm going to do this by myself.

509
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,240
You're soaking wet.

510
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,880
What are you going to do yourself?

511
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,080
Ballet.

512
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,880
I am going to do
a solo performance.

513
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,560
They turned me down.
I'll show them!

514
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,840
You won't succeed.

515
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,640
I am confident.

516
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,440
Everyone will laugh at you.

517
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,280
Adele.

518
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,800
Listen to your mother.

519
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,920
I will reserve 2 seats
for the both of you.

520
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,560
Front row.

521
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,160
All right.

522
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,240
But I'll probably be
there in half an hour.

523
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,600
Deni!

524
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,480
What is it?
–You'll see.

525
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,400
Open it.

526
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,000
You can come, right?

527
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,760
Say something.

528
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,760
I'm not sure about this.

529
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,440
I thought you were on my side.

530
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,320
I am,...

531
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,560
...but they'll turn against you!

532
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,000
I don't want
to see you end up hurt.

533
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,920
The person turning against me
is supposed to be supporting me.

534
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,440
Don't worry about me.
I'm getting used to going solo.

535
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,960
Don't be like that.

536
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,400
<i>Hi, I am Hana,</i>
<i>a writer for Hijab Magazine.</i>

537
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,000
<i>We met at a boutique</i>
<i>the other day...</i>

538
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,560
<i>...and I heard that you were</i>
<i>a ballerina and wears a hijab.</i>

539
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,120
<i>Can we meet?</i>

540
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,680
All praises to Allah.

541
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,160
Ballet is important to me.

542
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,040
Faith is also important to me.

543
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,800
I won't compromise
one for the other.

544
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,320
What do you want to say to those
who expect you to compromise?

545
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,960
Our religion gives
advice how we should dress.

546
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,920
But it doesn't say
that we should...

547
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,160
...waste our talent and ambition.

548
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,760
Why should I give all that up?
I just want to be...

549
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,760
...a good Muslim.

550
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,400
Your words are
an inspiration to me.

551
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,480
We're done.
I have everything I need.

552
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,720
I'm sure our readers
will love this story.

553
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,480
Adele, what is this?

554
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,040
It's my performance.

555
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,680
Do come if you like ballet.

556
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:30,040
I have never been
interested in ballet before.

557
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,480
But now, I wouldn't
want to miss this.

558
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,040
Thank you, Adele.

Nothing. I'm fine.

<i>Forget about the hijab.</i>
<i>I need you.</i>

much for today. See you tomorrow.

Miss Farah!
–Good to see you. What is it?

621
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:52,720
I need your help, Miss Farah.

622
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,720
Take a look at this.

623
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,360
She is really
going ahead with this.

624
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,960
I have already warned her.

625
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:01,160
So what are
we supposed to do now?

626
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,800
I have an idea.
Come with me.

627
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,360
What is it?

628
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,760
<i>Death to the infidel.</i>

629
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,000
<i>All praise to Allah...</i>

630

637
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,160
<i>...them with his binding evil.</i>
<i>They are ignorant to the truth.</i>

638
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,680
<i>Disobedient to the light.</i>

639
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,200
<i>We will stop them in the name</i>
<i>of Allah. Allah is Great.</i>

640
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,200
<i>Adele Shakiri.</i>
<i>Movements tracked.</i>

641
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,760
<i>LRT Kelana Jaya Line.</i>
<i>5 pm. Three days time.</i>

642
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:35,920
<i>Her pride will</i>
<i>not go unpunished.</i>

643
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,440
<i>We are there, brother.</i>
<i>God is great.</i>

644
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:39,240
<i>We will stop her</i>
<i>in the name of God.</i>

645
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,200
This isn't easy. I don't
want to get involved...

646
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:48,800
...without discussing
this with your daughter.

647
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,400
She has already
booked this place...

648
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,560
...and she has
paid for the deposit.

649
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,040
She is my client.
Not you.

650
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:00,400
I know. But please, Mr. Rul.

651
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:06,240
We understand your position,
but this is a unique case.

652
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:08,360
You have to help us.

653
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,160
Adele has been
getting threats merely...

654
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,000
...for promoting the show.
–That's right.

655
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,720
It would irresponsible...

656
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:20,760
...and dangerous if you
allow it to go ahead.

657
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,640
What if on the day
of the performance,...

658
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,480
...something bad happens?

659
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:29,320
It would give
your company a bad name.

660
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,440
Yes, indeed.
What do you say?

661
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:34,360
I cannot return the deposit.

662
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,280
That's not a problem.

663
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,400
Adele Shakiri.

664
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:25,480
You have rejected the truth.
Sooner or later...

665
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,640
...you will face your punishment.

666
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,640
I'm fine.

667
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:34,360
Really, Grandma.
You shouldn't have come.

668
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:39,600
But if you'll be staying
here for some time,...

669
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,480
...you can come and
watch my performance.

670
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,080
I would love for you to be there.

671
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,960
Adele! You've lost your mind.

672
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,440
That's enough.
Cancel the performance.

673
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,640
It's too dangerous.

674
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,120
You just need to rest, okay?

675
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:59,360
I need to do it, Grandma.

676
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:02,120
If not, all of this
would go to waste.

677
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,200
Poor Deni.

678
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:07,640
Adele.

679
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,120
Your safety is important.

680
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,440
That's enough. We won't
allow it. That is final.

681
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,320
Adele!

682
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,960
I have cancelled it.
Farah and I have taken...

683
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:31,240
...back the deposit
for the hall.

684
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,040
We don't want them
to go after you again.

685
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,600
Okay, dear?

686
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:40,880
<i>We are now at the hospital</i>
<i>where Adele Shakiri...</i>

687
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,400
<i>...is receiving treatment...</i>

688
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:43,920
<i>...after being brutally assaulted</i>
<i>by Jihadi activists.</i>

689
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:45,680
Ballerina Adele Shakiri was
brutally attacked yesterday.

690
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,200
She is lucky to be alive.
She was saved by a friend,...

691
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:49,440
...Danial bin Shahbudin, a fellow
dancer from her ballet school.

692
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:52,440
The police suspect this was
an attack by Jihadi extremists.

693
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:54,160
The attackers managed
to escape from security.

694
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,680
If you have seen
them or have...

695
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,200
...any information about
their whereabouts...

696
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:58,720
...please contact the nearest
police station immediately.

697
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,320
Adele!

698
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:04,160
Adele, can we ask you something?

699
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:08,120
Adele can you tell us
a little bit about Danial?

700
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:17,080
<i>These people are extremists...</i>

701
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:19,400
<i>...and every religion</i>
<i>has these groups.</i>

702
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,840
<i>They do not understand</i>
<i>the Holy Book...</i>

703
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:26,120
<i>...but they make interpretations</i>
<i>based on their little knowledge.</i>

704
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:30,200
<i>They distort the meanings</i>
<i>of what is said in the Book.</i>

705
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:36,320
<i>They don't realise what</i>
<i>they are doing is an act...</i>

706
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:40,680
<i>...of violation and is against</i>
<i>the teachings of the religion.</i>

707
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:45,480
<i>They continue to preach</i>
<i>in the name of God.</i>

708
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:49,240
<i>What about the intentions of</i>
<i>this girl who wears the hijab...</i>

709
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:51,080
<i>...and dances ballet?</i>

710
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:55,160
<i>Even though the girl shouldn't</i>
<i>have been attacked...</i>

711
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:59,440
<i>...that way, her intentions</i>
<i>to dance ballet...</i>

712
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:02,200
<i>...while wearing the hijab</i>
<i>is not appropriate.</i>

713
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,320
<i>It is contradictory.</i>

714
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,600
<i>Whether it is intentional</i>
<i>or otherwise,...</i>

715
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:11,280
<i>...it is as if she is making</i>
<i>a mockery of our faith...</i>

716
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,240
<i>...and it is wrong.</i>

717
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:18,000
<i>Imagine if other people</i>
<i>follow in her footsteps.</i>

718
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,360
<i>What would happen then?</i>

719
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:24,120
After this.....
–Will she agree to it?

720
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,600
Yes, but we have a few options.

721
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:28,720
I suggest my friend's place.

722
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:31,000
You should first ask her.
–I know, but I have...

723
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,280
...many friends.
–Hold on, she's here.

724
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:35,600
What's going on here?

725
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,960
Adele, we have discussed this...

726
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:44,920
...and  we have all agreed
that you need a break.

727
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,880
Get away from KL for a while.

728
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,840
Yes, I guess so.

729
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:56,040
I will stay with you, okay?

730
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:00,920
Yes you can, but this time...

731
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:04,000
...you will need to go
a bit further from KL.

732
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:08,600
What do you think about Perth?

733
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,960
Australia?

734
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,560
I don't understand.

735
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,760
I have a friend.
Her name is Laura.

736
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,720
She was my friend
when we were young.

737
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,720
You have met her several times.
Do you remember?

738
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,800
Yes, I remember.
–You remember?

739
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,640
Okay, she is now living in Perth.

740
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:34,240
She knows about what happened
to you. So I think,...

741
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:37,320
...we all think it would be
good for you to stay with her...

742
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:41,320
...for the time being until
things here settle.

743
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:43,240
Then you can come back.

744
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:47,720
If you don't like it, or you
don't feel comfortable there...

745
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,520
...you can come home earlier.

746
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,080
We are not forcing you, Adele.

747
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,240
It's just that for the
time being, we feel...

748
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:02,280
...it isn't safe for
you to be here right now.

749
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,840
Hold on. We are forcing
you a little bit.

750
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,640
But you can push all
that to the side, Adele.

751
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:17,760
I feel that living overseas
will be a valuable experience.

752
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,640
When I was younger,
I lived overseas too.

753
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,640
Tell Laura thank you
for her offer.

754
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:48,200
I'd love to go.

755
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,760
Adele.

756
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:01,240
All praises to Allah.

757
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,120
Take good care of yourself.

758
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,520
Let's go, Mum.
–Yes.

759
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,080
Hi!

760
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:05,160
Hi. I'm glad you're here.

761
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:08,400
Come in.

762
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,000
Come on, girls.
Let's show Adele inside.

763
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:23,360
They were so excited
to gain a big sister.

764
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,640
Do you need any help with
them while you're at work?

765
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,760
No, I mostly work
from home these days.

766
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:35,080
I'd like to make myself
a bit useful while I'm here.

767
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,880
Don't worry about that.
We didn't ask you here to work.

768
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:40,160
Besides, you'll be quite busy.

769
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:42,240
Busy?

770
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,320
Your mother didn't say?

771
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,280
That's odd.

772
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,880
I've arranged for you
to tutor a friend's daughter.

773
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:52,440
She's a very promising dancer but
she could use a few extra lessons.

774
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,840
She's coming here on Saturday.

775
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:57,720
All right.

776
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:02,200
Unless you don't want to do it.
I presumed you knew.

777
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:07,440
It's just that I've never
taught anyone before...

778
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:10,040
...but I'll give it a go.

779
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:14,040
Although I don't quite have
the right shoes with me.

780
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,280
I'll take you to get some.

781
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:19,120
It's very strange she didn't say.

782
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,640
I guess she didn't
want me to back out.

783
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:27,600
I wouldn't worry. It's just
been a tough time lately.

784
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:31,080
Yes, it has.

785
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:03,800
<i>Dear Adele, I hope Australia</i>
<i>is peaceful and sunny.</i>

786
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,480
<i>I miss having</i>
<i>you dance with us...</i>

787
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,160
<i>...and hope that you will change</i>
<i>your mind. Best wishes, Farah.</i>

788
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,480
Hi!
–Hi, Michelle.

789
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,800
Hi! It's so great to meet you.

790
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:35,680
Thank you so much for doing this.

791
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,320
I forgot to warn you how
much energy this one has.

792
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,160
Good luck!

793
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:54,120
Let's start by warming up.
–Okay.

794
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,480
Okay, we'll do 2 demi–plies.

795
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:04,080
Good. Open to second.

796
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:06,800
1 grand plie.

797
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:10,160
Knees over the toes.

798
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:12,640
Right.

799
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:15,080
Forward port de bras.

800
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:20,240
Recover...

801
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,320
...and rise.

802
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,200
Test your balance.

803
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,440
Good and second.

804
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:34,240
Can I ask?

805
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:36,480
How do you not overheat
with all that fabric on?

806
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:39,080
It's actually not
as thick as it looks...

807
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,880
...and it's also
designed for sports.

808
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:44,120
Oh, I see. How clever.

809
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:49,320
You know, I don't know
what all the fuss is about.

810
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
I mean, I heard
what happened to you.

811
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,480
I think you're super brave.

812
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,440
A lot of people are brave.

813
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,840
You're cool.
Do you want to...

814
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,440
...catch up for a coffee
or something some time?

815
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:07,640
Yeah, I'd like that.
–Great.

816
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:10,000
Thank you so much for today.
It was really great.

817
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:14,960
Got all your things?
–Yes.

818
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:16,840
So I'll see you again soon?
–Yeah.

819
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:16,280
It's okay. Keep going.

820
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:24,080
It's a bit chilly.
–It's okay. You'll get...

821
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,800
...warm soon.
–Okay.

822
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:28,720
Hold on.

823
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:44,000
Perfect.
–From the top.

824
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:54,760
Thank you!

825
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,360
Excellent.

826
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,160
Hey, my first solo show.

827
01:19:58,280 --> 01:19:59,680
Yeah!

828
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,120
Let's go.

829
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:18,160
What do you think?
–Good.

830
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:19,880
Yeah? Hi!

831
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,400
Hi, girls!
–Hello.

832
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,520
How are you?
What's your name?

833
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:25,040
Mia.
–Hi, Mia. How are you?

834
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:26,840
I'm Michelle.

835
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,160
Do you do ballet?
Yeah?

836
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,160
Would you like to show me some?

837
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,680
That was beautiful!

838
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,040
Can you show me anything else?

839
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:43,480
That was stunning.

840
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,400
Do you reckon you can copy me?

841
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:49,080
Yeah? So raise your
hand up in the air...

842
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:51,600
...and in front...

843
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,360
...and back.

844
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:55,280
Got. Now the other side.

845
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,520
Cross and back.

846
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:01,320
That was beautiful. We will
do a pirouette together.

847
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:03,160
Ready? Hands up.

848
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,120
Terrorist!

849
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:38,640
What's wrong?

850
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:46,560
Someone just spat at me.

851
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:49,560
On the street.
–What?

852
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:52,840
He called me...

853
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:54,480
...a terrorist.

854
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,840
Adele!

855
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:01,120
What is wrong with people?

856
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:04,400
If only we knew
the answer to that.

857
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:07,600
I don't believe it.
You came here...

858
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:09,600
...to get away from all of this.

859
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,720
I'm so sorry.

860
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:17,120
I just didn't think that something
like this would happen here.

861
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,360
I don't know why.

862
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:24,080
The world is a dark place
for us these days.

863
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:32,480
Perhaps...

864
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,560
...you shouldn't wear it.

865
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,440
No. That is not the answer.

866
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,640
I've come this far.

867
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,600
I can't let them win.

868
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:45,760
I worry for you.

869
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:49,200
I worry for the world.

870
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:55,960
Maybe tomorrow we can work
on something more advanced.

871
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,640
Yeah, that'd be great.

872
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:00,720
What do you suggest?
–Maybe pirouettes?

873
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:02,920
Thank you.
–Thank you.

874
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,600
Yeah, that'd be great.

875
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,280
See you later.
–Bye!

876
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:18,280
Hey, wait! I'll walk you.

877
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,400
Oh, no. It's okay.
It's out of the way for you.

878
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:22,360
Are you sure?
–Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow?

879
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,320
Yeah, definitely.
–Okay, bye!

880
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:40,040
We don't like
terrorists around here.

881
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,600
Neither do I.

882
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,520
Let me pass.

883
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,400
<i>Adele!</i>

884
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,160
<i>You can't interrupt our class.</i>

885
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,680
<i>Terrorist!</i>

886
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,160
<i>Perhaps...</i>

887
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,200
<i>...you shouldn't wear it.</i>

888
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:45,440
I know.

889
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:48,680
I understand. It's not
what either of us wanted.

890
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,240
I know.
I've tried. I really have.

891
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:53,080
I'm actually
really worried about her.

892
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:55,320
She's not herself.

893
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:00,120
I can hardly blame her
with those horrible boys...

894
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:02,280
...and the things
they said and did.

895
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:07,360
I'm so sorry.

896
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:12,080
Yeah, but we have
to respect her decision.

897
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:16,160
She said
she's ready to come home.

898
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:50,960
Thank you so much.

899
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:52,800
I won't forget a thing
that you taught me.

900
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,000
Keep in touch.
–Definitely.

901
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,560
Thank you.

902
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,600
Adele.

903
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:05,240
Mum didn't come?

904
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:17,840
Careful, Adele.

905
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:27,520
Mum!
–Adele!

906
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:29,680
Adele.

907
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:32,200
I didn't think you
would come home so early!

908
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,320
Where were you?

909
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:40,560
I was here.
I'm always here, dear.

910
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:45,320
I will always be by your side.

911
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:49,040
I know.

912
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:38,960
I will stop dancing ballet.

913
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:50,280
This is a gift to me.

914
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:55,360
I know that this
is a difficult choice.

915
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:58,240
The most important thing is...

916
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:01,160
...how we connect with the world.

917
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:03,240
Not just to live.

918
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:08,960
Make use of everything
you have learnt.

919
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:11,600
Take whatever is
beautiful from dance...

920
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,520
...and live your
life as a good Muslim.

921
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,880
<i>3 months later.</i>

922
01:31:56,440 --> 01:31:57,840
Adele, can you come out
for a moment?

923
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:59,800
But I'm.....
–Hurry!

924
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:10,920
Surprise.

925
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:14,680
Come here.

926
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:18,720
Come here, Adele.

927
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:22,200
What is it?
–Here.

928
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:03,400
I love this country.
–Yes.

929
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:06,400
Yeah, it's so nice. We should
go shopping after this.

930
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:08,680
Yes.
–I have been planning...

931
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:10,200
...for the weekends.

932
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:12,480
Maybe we can explore the city.

933
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:15,640
Yeah, sure.

934
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:17,760
Hold on.

935
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,760
Hi, Mum!

936
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:23,600
Just arrived in Brussels.

937
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,160
I'm good.
